There are many ways to launch the GUI on system boot for Linux (Ubuntu), but I followed this automated method:
1. Create a simple shell script (attached - gci.sh)
2. Insert the script into the autostart menu (see attached screenshot) for ubuntu.
3. Done

2nd Method:
1. Create a service (gci2.service - see attached)
2. Test it, enable it and start it by sudo systemctl start (enable) gci2.service
3. Done
